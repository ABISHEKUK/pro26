Make cake: Preheat oven to 350º and spray 9”-x-13” baking pan with cooking spray. 
In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients and set aside. 
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, oil, milk, and vanilla extract. Pour wet ingredients into dry and whisk to combine. Quickly whisk in the boiling water, the mixture will be very thin. 
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 35-40 minutes. 
Poke cake all over with the handle of a wooden spoon. In a small bowl, whisk together the pudding mix and milk for 2 minutes until it’s smooth. Pour pudding into holes of the warm cake. 
Make frosting: In a microwave-safe bowl, break up ¾ of chocolate bar into pieces and microwave on high for 20 seconds. Stir chocolate and continue to microwave in 20-second increments until melted. 
Fold melted chocolate into 1 container of Cool Whip. Spread the chocolate frosting evenly over cake and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. 
Using a peeler, shave remaining ¼ bar of chocolate. When ready to serve the cake, spread more Cool Whip in the center of the frosted cake and decorate with chocolate shavings. Garnish with maraschino cherries.
